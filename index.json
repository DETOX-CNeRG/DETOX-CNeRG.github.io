Hate speech detection requires overwhelming resources including high-performance computing for online posts and tweets monitoring as well as thousands of human experts for daily screening of suspected posts or tweets. Recently, Deep Learning (DL)-based solutions have been proposed for automatic detection of hate speech, using modest-sized training datasets of few thousands of hate speech sequences. While these methods perform well on the specific datasets, their ability to detect new hate speech sequences is limited and has not been investigated. Being a data-driven approach, it is well known that DL surpasses other methods whenever a scale-up in train dataset size and diversity is achieved. Therefore, we first present a dataset of 1 million realistic hate and non-hate sequences, produced by a deep generative language model. We further utilize the generated dataset to train a well-studied DL-based hate speech detector, and demonstrate consistent and significant performance improvements across five public hate speech datasets. Therefore, the proposed solution enables high sensitivity detection of a very large variety of hate speech sequences, paving the way to a fully automatic solution.","tags":["Detection","Survey","English"],"title":"A survey on automatic detection of hate speech in text","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[Ziqi Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Ziqi+Zhang\u0026btnG=)","[David Robinson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=David+Robinson\u0026btnG=)","[Jonathan Tepper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Jonathan+Tepper\u0026btnG=)"],"categories":null,"content":"Main contributions Coming soon\nLimitations Coming soon\nFuture Directions Coming soon\n","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"e82d051510d4012bd4e8a6be6e1064dd","permalink":"/publication/zhang2018detecting/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang2018detecting/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, the increasing propagation of hate speech on social media and the urgent need for effective counter-measures have drawn significant investment from governments, companies, and researchers. A large number of methods have been developed for automated hate speech detection online. This aims to classify textual content into non-hate or hate speech, in which case the method may also identify the targeting characteristics (i.e., types of hate, such as race, and religion) in the hate speech. However, we notice significant difference between the performance of the two (i.e., non-hate v.s. hate). In this work, we argue for a focus on the latter problem for practical reasons. We show that it is a much more challenging task, as our analysis of the language in the typical datasets shows that hate speech lacks unique, discriminative features and therefore is found in the long tail in a dataset that is difficult to discover. We then propose Deep Neural Network structures serving as feature extractors that are particularly effective for capturing the semantics of hate speech. Our methods are evaluated on the largest collection of hate speech datasets based on Twitter, and are shown to be able to outperform the best performing method by up to 5 percentage points in macro-average F1, or 8 percentage points in the more challenging case of identifying hateful content.","tags":["English"],"title":"Detecting hate speech on twitter using a convolution-gru based deep neural network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[James Weinstein](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=James+Weinstein\u0026btnG=)"],"categories":null,"content":"Main contributions Coming soon\nLimitations Coming soon\nFuture Directions Coming soon\n","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"8c064b5783af36609d773b5c5dd030f4","permalink":"/publication/weinstein2018hate/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/weinstein2018hate/","section":"publication","summary":"While social media empowers freedom of expression and individual voices, it also enables anti-social behavior, online harassment, cyberbullying, and hate speech. In this paper, we deepen our understanding of online hate speech by focusing on a largely neglected but crucial aspect of hate speech -- its target: either directed towards a specific person or entity, or generalized towards a group of people sharing a common protected characteristic. We perform the first linguistic and psycholinguistic analysis of these two forms of hate speech and reveal the presence of interesting markers that distinguish these types of hate speech. Our analysis reveals that Directed hate speech, in addition to being more personal and directed, is more informal, angrier, and often explicitly attacks the target (via name calling) with fewer analytic words and more words suggesting authority and influence. Generalized hate speech, on the other hand, is dominated by religious hate, is characterized by the use of lethal words such as murder, exterminate, and kill; and quantity words such as million and many. Altogether, our work provides a data-driven analysis of the nuances of online-hate speech that enables not only a deepened understanding of hate speech and its social implications but also its detection.","tags":["English"],"title":"Hate speech, pornography, and radical attacks on free speech doctrine","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[Mainack Mondal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Mainack+Mondal\u0026btnG=)","[Leandro Araujo Silva](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Leandro+Araujo+Silva\u0026btnG=)","[Fabricio Benevenuto](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Fabricio+Benevenuto\u0026btnG=)"],"categories":null,"content":"Main contributions Coming soon\nLimitations Coming soon\nFuture Directions Coming soon\n","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"a359d73fe3656a93def23f8f9da8acf5","permalink":"/publication/mondal2017measurement/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mondal2017measurement/","section":"publication","summary":"Social media systems allow Internet users a congenial platform to freely express their thoughts and opinions. Although this property represents incredible and unique communication opportunities, it also brings along important challenges. Online hate speech is an archetypal example of such challenges. Despite its magnitude and scale, there is a significant gap in understanding the nature of hate speech on social media. In this paper, we provide the first of a kind systematic large scale measurement study of the main targets of hate speech in online social media. To do that, we gather traces from two social media systems: Whisper and Twitter. We then develop and validate a methodology to identify hate speech on both these systems.

Previous research has primarily focused on the development of NLP methods to automatically and effectively detect online hate speech while disregarding further action needed to calm and discourage individuals from using hate speech in the future. In addition, most existing hate speech datasets treat each post as an isolated instance, ignoring the conversational context. In this paper, we propose a novel task of generative hate speech intervention, where the goal is to automatically generate responses to intervene during online conversations that contain hate speech. As a part of this work, we introduce two fully-labeled large-scale hate speech intervention datasets collected from Gab and Reddit. These datasets provide conversation segments, hate speech labels, as well as intervention responses written by Mechanical Turk Workers. In this paper, we also analyze the datasets to understand the common intervention strategies and explore the performance of common automatic response generation methods on these new datasets to provide a benchmark for future research.","tags":["Detection","Survey","English"],"title":"A survey on hate speech detection using natural language processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[Thomas Davidson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Thomas+Davidson\u0026btnG=)","[Dana Warmsley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Dana+Warmsley\u0026btnG=)","[Michael Macy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Michael+Macy\u0026btnG=)","[Ingmar Weber](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Ingmar+Weber\u0026btnG=)"],"categories":null,"content":"Main contributions Coming soon\nLimitations Coming soon\nFuture Directions Coming soon\n","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"906720c609f467a54f13cb5e4bad4be3","permalink":"/publication/davidson2017automated/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/davidson2017automated/","section":"publication","summary":"A key challenge for automatic hate-speech detection on social media is the separation of hate speech from other instances of offensive language. Lexical detection methods tend to have low precision because they classify all messages containing particular terms as hate speech and previous work using supervised learning has failed to distinguish between the two categories. We used a crowd-sourced hate speech lexicon to collect tweets containing hate speech keywords. We use crowd-sourcing to label a sample of these tweets into three categories: those containing hate speech, only offensive language, and those with neither. We train a multi-class classifier to distinguish between these different categories. Close analysis of the predictions and the errors shows when we can reliably separate hate speech from other offensive language and when this differentiation is more difficult. We find that racist and homophobic tweets are more likely to be classified as hate speech but that sexist tweets are generally classified as offensive.

In this paper, we propose a novel method on a fine-grained hate speech classification task, which focuses on differentiating among 40 hate groups of 13 different hate group categories. We first explore the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) as a discriminative model and then extend it to a hierarchical architecture to utilize the additional hate category information for more accurate prediction. Experimentally, we show that incorporating the hate category information for training can significantly improve the classification performance and our proposed model outperforms commonly-used discriminative models.","tags":["Bias","English"],"title":"A valid question: Could hate speech condition bias in the brain?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[Zeerak Waseem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Zeerak+Waseem\u0026btnG=)"],"categories":null,"content":"Main contributions Coming soon\nLimitations Coming soon\nFuture Directions Coming soon\n","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"ea3d5b4dee6ed4509dda27e113534bf9","permalink":"/publication/waseem2016you/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/waseem2016you/","section":"publication","summary":"Some users of social media are spreading racist, sexist, and otherwise hateful content. For the purpose of training a hate speech detection system, the reliability of the annotations is crucial, but there is no universally agreed-upon definition. We collected potentially hateful messages and asked two groups of internet users to determine whether they were hate speech or not, whether they should be banned or not and to rate their degree of offensiveness. One of the groups was shown a definition prior to completing the survey. We aimed to assess whether hate speech can be annotated reliably, and the extent to which existing definitions are in accordance with subjective ratings. Our results indicate that showing users a definition caused them to partially align their own opinion with the definition but did not improve reliability, which was very low overall. We conclude that the presence of hate speech should perhaps not be considered a binary yes-or-no decision, and raters need more detailed instructions for the annotation.","tags":["Detection","English"],"title":"Are you a racist or am i seeing things? annotator influence on hate speech detection on twitter","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[Mark Walters](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Mark+Walters\u0026btnG=)","[Rupert Brown](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Rupert+Brown\u0026btnG=)","[Susann Wiedlitzka](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Susann+Wiedlitzka\u0026btnG=)"],"categories":null,"content":"Main contributions Coming soon\nLimitations Coming soon\nFuture Directions Coming soon\n","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"39ad5cf59bdd996f0bdee7322e2b9bb9","permalink":"/publication/walters2016causes/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/walters2016causes/","section":"publication","summary":"We study malicious online content via a specific type of hate speech: race, ethnicity and national-origin based discrimination in social media, alongside hate crimes motivated by those characteristics, in 100 cities across the United States.

A large number of methods have been developed for automated hate speech detection online. This aims to classify textual content into non-hate or hate speech, in which case the method may also identify the targeting characteristics (i.e., types of hate, such as race, and religion) in the hate speech. However, we notice significant difference between the performance of the two (i.e., non-hate v.s. hate). In this work, we argue for a focus on the latter problem for practical reasons. We show that it is a much more challenging task, as our analysis of the language in the typical datasets shows that hate speech lacks unique, discriminative features and therefore is found in the long tail in a dataset that is difficult to discover. We then propose Deep Neural Network structures serving as feature extractors that are particularly effective for capturing the semantics of hate speech. Our methods are evaluated on the largest collection of hate speech datasets based on Twitter, and are shown to be able to outperform the best performing method by up to 5 percentage points in macro-average F1, or 8 percentage points in the more challenging case of identifying hateful content.","tags":["Detection","English"],"title":"Hateful symbols or hateful people? predictive features for hate speech detection on twitter","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[John R Blosnich](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=John+R+Blosnich\u0026btnG=)","[Mary C Marsiglio](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Mary+C+Marsiglio\u0026btnG=)","[Shasha Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Shasha+Gao\u0026btnG=)","[Adam J Gordon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Adam+J+Gordon\u0026btnG=)","[Jillian C Shipherd](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Jillian+C+Shipherd\u0026btnG=)","[Michael Kauth](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Michael+Kauth\u0026btnG=)","[George R Brown](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=George+R+Brown\u0026btnG=)","[Michael J Fine](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Michael+J+Fine\u0026btnG=)"],"categories":null,"content":"Main contributions Coming soon\nLimitations Coming soon\nFuture Directions Coming soon\n","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"d8572f6ace6851714d120ee1766b95e6","permalink":"/publication/blosnich2016mental/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/blosnich2016mental/","section":"publication","summary":"We study malicious online content via a specific type of hate speech: race, ethnicity and national-origin based discrimination in social media, alongside hate crimes motivated by those characteristics, in 100 cities across the United States.

Recently, the offline causes that contribute to online hate speech have received increasing attention. A recurring question is whether the occurrence of extreme events offline systematically triggers bursts of hate speech online, indicated by peaks in the volume of hateful social media posts. Formally, this question translates into measuring the association between a sparse event series and a time series. We propose a novel statistical methodology to measure, test and visualize the systematic association between rare events and peaks in a time series. In contrast to previous methods for causal inference or independence tests on time series, our approach focuses only on the timing of events and peaks, and no other distributional characteristics. We follow the framework of event coincidence analysis (ECA) that was originally developed to correlate point processes. We formulate a discrete-time variant of ECA and derive all required distributions to enable analyses of peaks in time series, with a special focus on serial dependencies and peaks over multiple thresholds. The analysis gives rise to a novel visualization of the association via quantile-trigger rate plots. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by analyzing whether Islamist terrorist attacks in Western Europe and North America systematically trigger bursts of hate speech and counter-hate speech on Twitter.","tags":["English"],"title":"The affinity between online and offline anti-Muslim hate crime: Dynamics and impacts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[Jason Chan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Jason+Chan\u0026btnG=)","[Anindya Ghose](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Anindya+Ghose\u0026btnG=)","[Robert Seamans](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Robert+Seamans\u0026btnG=)"],"categories":null,"content":"Main contributions Coming soon\nLimitations Coming soon\nFuture Directions Coming soon\n","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"1bc2832ddb687f9849db070aac9f55fc","permalink":"/publication/chan2016internet/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chan2016internet/","section":"publication","summary":"The spread of COVID-19 has sparked racism, hate, and xenophobia in social media targeted at Chinese and broader Asian communities. However, little is known about how racial hate spreads during a pandemic and the role of counterhate speech in mitigating the spread. Here we study the evolution and spread of anti-Asian hate speech through the lens of Twitter. We create COVID-HATE, the largest dataset of anti-Asian hate and counterhate spanning three months, containing over 30 million tweets, and a social network with over 87 million nodes. By creating a novel hand-labeled dataset of 2,400 tweets, we train a text classifier to identify hate and counterhate tweets that achieves an average AUROC of 0.852. We identify 891,204 hate and 200,198 counterhate tweets in COVID-HATE. Using this data to conduct longitudinal analysis, we find that while hateful users are less engaged in the COVID-19 discussions prior to their first anti-Asian tweet, they become more vocal and engaged afterwards compared to counterhate users. We find that bots comprise 10.4% of hateful users and are more vocal and hateful compared to non-bot users. Comparing bot accounts, we show that hateful bots are more successful in attracting followers compared to counterhate bots. Analysis of the social network reveals that hateful and counterhate users interact and engage extensively with one another, instead of living in isolated polarized communities. Furthermore, we find that hate is contagious and nodes are highly likely to become hateful after being exposed to hateful content. Importantly, our analysis reveals that counterhate messages can discourage users from turning hateful in the first place. Overall, this work presents a comprehensive overview of anti-Asian hate and counterhate content during a pandemic. The COVID-HATE dataset is available at http://claws.cc.gatech.edu/covid.","tags":["Racial","English"],"title":"The internet and racial hate crime: Offline spillovers from online access","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[Carmen Aguilera-Carnerero](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Carmen+Aguilera-Carnerero\u0026btnG=)","[Abdul Halik Azeez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Abdul+Halik+Azeez\u0026btnG=)"],"categories":null,"content":"Main contributions Coming soon\nLimitations Coming soon\nFuture Directions Coming soon\n","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"a33fd447dd1665561b305c3db9e96f03","permalink":"/publication/aguilera2016islamonausea/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aguilera2016islamonausea/","section":"publication","summary":"While social media empowers freedom of expression and individual voices, it also enables anti-social behavior, online harassment, cyberbullying, and hate speech. In this paper, we deepen our understanding of online hate speech by focusing on a largely neglected but crucial aspect of hate speech -- its target: either directed towards a specific person or entity, or generalized towards a group of people sharing a common protected characteristic. We perform the first linguistic and psycholinguistic analysis of these two forms of hate speech and reveal the presence of interesting markers that distinguish these types of hate speech. Our analysis reveals that Directed hate speech, in addition to being more personal and directed, is more informal, angrier, and often explicitly attacks the target (via name calling) with fewer analytic words and more words suggesting authority and influence. Generalized hate speech, on the other hand, is dominated by religious hate, is characterized by the use of lethal words such as murder, exterminate, and kill; and quantity words such as million and many. Altogether, our work provides a data-driven analysis of the nuances of online-hate speech that enables not only a deepened understanding of hate speech and its social implications but also its detection.","tags":["English"],"title":"‘Islamonausea, not Islamophobia’: The many faces of cyber hate speech","type":"publication"}]
