      <description>&lt;p&gt;To deter the spread of hate speech, organizations have adopted several policies. These include the general policies like deletion of posts and/or accounts, shadow banning to softer approaches like counterspeech. Policies like banning/deletion seem to be effective in some cases, but there are issues of violation of freedom of speech. Recent research have started looking into automated generation of counterspeech as well.&lt;/p&gt;
